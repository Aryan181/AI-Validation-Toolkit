# AI Validation Toolkit

This repository contains Python scripts for AI-driven validation of citations using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It includes a basic citation validator and an advanced, context-aware citation validator.

## Description

The `AI Validation Toolkit` offers two main scripts:

- `basic_citation_validator.py`: A script that demonstrates basic AI-driven citation validation.
- `advanced_contextual_validator.py`: An enhanced script that employs context-aware validation, leveraging the 'chain of thought' reasoning approach.

These scripts are designed to interact with OpenAI's API to validate citations within given texts, making them useful tools for projects requiring automated content verification.
